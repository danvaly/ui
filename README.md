## Introduction

While Laravel does not dictate which JavaScript or CSS pre-processors you use, it does provide a basic starting point using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and / or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) that will be helpful for many applications. By default, Laravel uses [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/) to install both of these frontend packages.

**We are not accepting new presets.**

## Documentation

Documentation can be found on the [Laravel website](https://laravel.com/docs/frontend).
